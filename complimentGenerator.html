	<h6> Welcome! Here is our project for this hackathon.</h6>
	<br>
	<h6> Component 1: The first part is a customizable study timer. This was inspired by the widely accredited Pomodoro study technique. </h6>
	<h6> Traditional Pomodoro timers are, unfortunately, confined to intervals of 25 minutes and 5 minutes. The timer on this webpage allows </h6>
	<h6> a user to decide how long they want their study sessions to be. In addition, this timer also includes suggestions for stress-relief activities </h6>
	<h6> to partake in during the break interval. Unfortunately, at the moment, this timer does not time breaks intervals. This is both an </h6>
	<h6> advantage and disadvantage because while it allows for flexibility with break times, it does not hold the user strictly accountable </h6>
	<h6> in terms of ensuring that they do not take excessively long breaks. However, since this hackathon was about putting a smile on people's</h6>
	<h6> faces, we figured that more flexible break intervals would be alright. </h6>
	<br>
	<h6> Component 2: The second part is a complimentor. A compliment has the potential to put a lasting smile on someone's face, and although </h6>
	<h6> this complimentor cannot replace actual, interpersonal compliments, we hoped that this component would make someone's day a little better. </h6>
